infix notation

2 + 2

functional notation

f(2, 2) = 2 + 3 (this is not an assignment)

prefix notation

+ 2 2

postfix notation

2 2 +

infix notation uses parentheses that define groups of operands and operators, 
define the sequence in which operations must be conducted.

if there are no parentheses, then we use rules of priority.

language Forth uses RPN.

that's why it's easier to implement.


example:

2 + 3 - 5

would look 2 3 + 5 - in rpn.

therefore:


  2     3        +      5      -
Stack:
|  |   |  |    |  |    |  |   |  |
|  |   |3 |    |  |    |5 |   |  |
|2 |   |2 |    |5 |    |5 |   |0 |
