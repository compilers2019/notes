Course Structure 
Three 50 minute class meetings per week, with homework in accordance with the syllabus. All readings and submissions must be completed on the day due. One project, two midterms and a final exam at the end of the course. Class attendance is mandatory.
Syllabus plan is subject to change and serves mere as a roadmap, rather than exact schedule.

Method of Evaluation 

Student learning will be evaluated on the basis of the following weighted components: 

• Homework assignments        20% of final grade 
• Grade of midterm examinations    25% 
• Projects                25% 
• Grade of final examination        30%
